        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p style="font-size: large;">I am an aspiring developer learning the tools of the trade. I mainly focus on Java
            because of my passion -
            Minecraft. I love to code mods and such for the game.<br>I have made a forge mod and some spigot projects. I
            also dabble in python, C++, and, of course, web development. I am currently learning React (this website<br>
            uses React!) and working on a compiler to transpile python into C++.
